**BrickMania** is a modern take on the classic **BrickBreaker** game.

The game is currently under development, and I plan to implement numerous updates and changes to the code. (Stay tuned for future updates!)

- Move the block using the **WASD** or **Arrow** keys.
- Pause or resume the game by pressing the **Spacebar**.
- To quit the game while it’s not running, press the **Q** key.
- To go back to main menu press **Left Shift** key.



On the start menu, you can select certain options that modify gameplay. Currently, these settings do not persist across restarts, but this feature is planned for future updates.

You can navigate the options using the arrow keys.

- **Mute Music** / **Unmute Music**: Mutes / Unmutes the game’s music and sounds.



Special moves are powerful abilities with cooldowns. There are currently **2** special moves available:

- Every 20 seconds, you’ll gain a **SPECIAL Ball**, which is red in color. You can activate it by pressing either the **W** key or the **Down Arrow** key.
  
- Every 60 seconds, you’ll unlock the **Brick Destruction** powerup, which instantly destroys all remaining bricks on the board.



Powerups are items that drop randomly as you play, either after destroying bricks or at specific intervals.

- After breaking a brick, there’s a chance an **Extra Ball** powerup will begin to fall. Catch it, and you’ll gain an additional ball that can help you clear more bricks! However, be cautious—each extra ball makes the game significantly faster!




- If you stay stationary for too long (5 seconds), the paddle will move on its own.

Enjoy the game, and be on the lookout for new updates in the future!
